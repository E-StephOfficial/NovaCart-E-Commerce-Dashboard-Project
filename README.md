## Business Scenario
NovaCart, an e-commerce company, wants to better understand its sales performance, product category revenue, marketing effectiveness, and regional return rates. Executives require a **single, interactive dashboard** that summarizes key insights without having to sift through lengthy reports.


## Business Questions
1. How have sales trended over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly)?  
2. Which product categories drive the most revenue?  
3. Which marketing channels deliver the highest ROI?  
4. What are the product return rates by country or region?  
5. Which markets generate both strong sales and efficient ROI?  


## Dashboard Walkthrough
1. **Sales Trend (Line Chart)** – Shows sales evolution over time.  
2. **Revenue by Category (Clustered Column)** – Highlights top-performing product lines.  
3. **Marketing ROI by Channel** – Compares marketing channels based on return on investment.  
4. **Return Rate by Country (Horizontal Bar Chart)** – Monitors quality and customer satisfaction across regions.  
5. **Sales vs ROI (Scatter Plot)** – Identifies markets with strong revenue and efficient returns.  
6. **Slicers** – Allows filtering by Date, Country, Category, and Marketing Channel for dynamic analysis.  
7. **Executive Summary** – Short report summarizing key insights for decision-makers.
